(In Progress) Working in a team to design, build, and deploy a health care web
application that follows the Django Framework’s MTV design pattern. Front-end
development is handled with HTML5/CSS3 and Django’s Template Language for
dynamic web page handling. SQLite3 and Python are handling information
processing and storing.
