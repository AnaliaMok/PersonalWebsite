Hi, I'm Analia, a third year Computer Science student at Rochester Institute of
Technology. I am currently pursuing my undergrad in CS as well as completing a
minor in Mobile Development. Why these two studies? Well, because I have a split
creativity: one side is more analytical and academic, and the other is more
artistic. CS allows me to continue to use my analytical mind as I dive deeper
into the world of computers and programming. Meanwhile, mobile - and technically
web - dev brings out my artistic creativity while still combining with my love
for programming. It's hard to choose between CS and Mobile Dev, so why not both?
Currently, I expect to graduate in May 2020 as I am in a 5-year co-op program.
However, I am planning to extend my graduation date to May 2021 to pursue an
Accelerated Masters with an emphasis on Computer Graphics.

I am currently unavailable for hire until Spring 2019.
