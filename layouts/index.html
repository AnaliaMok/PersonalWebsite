        <p>
            Hi, I'm Analia, a third year Computer Science student at Rochester
            Institute of Technology. I am currently pursuing my undergrad in CS
            as well as completing a minor in Mobile Development. Why these two
            studies? Well, because I have a split creativity: one side is more
            analytical and academic, and the other is more artistic. CS allows
            me to continue to use my analytical mind as I dive deeper into the
            world of computers and programming. Meanwhile, mobile - and
            technically web - dev brings out my artisitic creativity while still
            combining with my love for programming. It's hard to choose between
            CS and Mobile Dev, so why not both? Currently, I expect to graduate
            in May 2020 as I am in a 5-year co-op program. However, I am
            planning to extend my graduation date to May 2021 to pursue an
            Accelerated Masters with an emphasis on Computer Graphics.
        </p>
        <p>I am currently unavailable for hire until Spring 2019.</p>
