# PersonalWebsite
## Purpose:
This is currently a development repository for my personal website. The actual site is hosted on GitHub Page, which is being served by a different public repository. At the moment, the hosted site is an "Under Construction"
page with minimal content.

## What will be included in the website?
This website will serve as sort of a one-stop shop for people to learn about me professionally. It will serve as another digital copy of
my resume, and projects/portfolio pieces. However, all code will still be stored in their respective repositories here on GitHub.

## Technologies:
I am currently developing the website using the Hugo static site generator since GitHub pages can only host static sites.
Using Hugo will help make development quicker, and thanks to its "CMS" structure, it will be easier to add and adjust content
in the long run. Besides Hugo, the website is being developed with the typical HTML5/CSS3 and javascript.
